This problem is about reading the program rather than writing code. A fourteen digit number will have 9**14 possibilities (if no digit can be 0)

This problem needs to be considered like a stack of base 26 numbers

I made some insights here, but missed the crucial part about this being a stack. Fun problem, even though I spent a long time making not much progress.

There are loads of great solutions online, this is the one that I liked the most
