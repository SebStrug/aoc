Could have just used modulo instead of some fancy if/else statement. We're trying to go back to the 0th index, not the -1 index! I was too careful after being burned with indices in previous problems

This is an example of the
Biham–Middleton–Levine traffic model

Cellular automata problem

`list(line) for line...` is much nicer than `[c for c in line] for line in...`
