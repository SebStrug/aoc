When storing data or processing a list or list of lists, use indices. You can always use indices to get to a value, but not necessarily vice versa.


Nice way to get neighbours from a solutions megathread, by 4HbQ
Using a dictionary to define the set of points
```python
e = {(x,y):int(e) for x,l in enumerate(open(0))
                  for y,e in enumerate(l.strip())}

def neighbours(x,y): return filter(e.get, 
            [(x+1,y+1),(x+1,y),(x+1,y-1),(x,y+1),
             (x-1,y-1),(x-1,y),(x-1,y+1),(x,y-1)])

count = 0
for step in range(1, 1000):
    for i in e: e[i] += 1
    flashing = {i for i in e if e[i] > 9}

    while flashing:
        f = flashing.pop()
        e[f] = 0
        count += 1
        for n in neighbours(*f):
            e[n] += 1
            if e[n] > 9: flashing.add(n)

    if step == 100: print(count)
    if sum(e.values()) == 0: print(step); break
```

Much simpler to keep one set of the flashing ones and keep adding to it, just keeping a running count
