# part 1
Fairly simple

# part 2
much harder than part 1. Discussed this with work colleagues (Ben, Ronan) who talked through a solution of overlapping cubes.

# Notes
See
1. Constructive solid geometry https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry

Other people carved up slices of the overall cube, you have to 'carve off' six times, once for each face
