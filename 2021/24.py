# 14 instructions, all very similar

# each 'inp' inputs the next character
# of the 14 digit number (1-9 allowed only)

# deleted instructions that are `div z 1`, these don't do anything

# instructions only differ on third line (add x ...)
# and the third line from the end (add y ...)

# each instruction...
# starts by setting x and y to 0 before they are used (mul x 0)

# the use of mod strongly hints that we are in base 26
