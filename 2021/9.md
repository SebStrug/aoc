## part 1

Would be more python to iterate over the two lists
[-1, 0, 1, 0]
[0, -1, 0, 1]

instead of (-1, 0, 1), (-1, 0, 1)

Rows are len(my_list)
Columns are len(my_list[0 ])

## part 2

breadth-first search or floodfill
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search
```
 1  procedure BFS(G, root) is
 2      let Q be a queue
 3      label root as explored
 4      Q.enqueue(root)
 5      while Q is not empty do
 6          v := Q.dequeue()
 7          if v is the goal then
 8              return v
 9          for all edges from v to w in G.adjacentEdges(v) do
10              if w is not labeled as explored then
11                  label w as explored
12                  Q.enqueue(w)
```

```
Flood-fill (node):
 1. If node is not Inside return.
 2. Set the node
 3. Perform Flood-fill one step to the south of node.
 4. Perform Flood-fill one step to the north of node
 5. Perform Flood-fill one step to the west of node
 6. Perform Flood-fill one step to the east of node
 7. Return.
```

Nice solution
