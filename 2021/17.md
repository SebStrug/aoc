Had to manually mess around with ranges and steps

Not very efficient solution

Analytical solution from reddit for part 1:
```
every upward trajectory comes back down to y=0 with velocity vy=-vy_start. The largest this may be is sucht, that you reach the lower edge of the landing zone in exactly a single step and thus vy=-y1-1 for the maximum height trajectory. Summing up you get ymax=(y1)*(y1+1)/2
```
